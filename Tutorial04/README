Tutorial #4 - Loading and Displaying an Image
---------------------------------------------

Objective:
	Replace our colorful rectangle with an image of a caveman.

Steps:
	1) Start with Tutorial03.
	2) Add the caveman.png image into an Images folder in the project, and set its "Copy to
	   Output Directory" property to either "Copy if newer" or "Copy always."
	3) Add the private variables "charTextureId" and "charSize". Initialize "charSize" at 64
	   since the caveman we are using is 64 pixels wide by 64 pixels tall.
	4) Add a new static helper class called Utilities with a single method LoadTexture(). See
	   code for its implementation and comments.
	5) Change OnLoad() to enable the Texture2D state in OpenGL and load the caveman.png from
	   the filesystem (and store id in "charTextureId").
	6) Change OnRenderFrame() to use texture coordinates instead of color codes. Since our
	   caveman.png file has only one image, we will use the whole image.
	7) Change OnRenderFrame() to draw a 64x64 square so it matches our image size.

Take Note of the Following:
	1) If our image is 64px by 64px, why are we using the texture coordinates from (0,0) to
	   (1,1) instead of (0,0) to (64,64)?
	2) The image contains transparency around our caveman, so why does he show up with a
	   solid white background behind him?
