Tutorial #3 - Matrices, the Orthographic View, and Rotations
------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
	Rotate the rectangle around the center point of the screen, and remove the distortions that
	occur when resizing the window.

Steps:
	1) Start with Tutorial02.
	2) Add the private variable "rotation" for later use, initialized at 0.
	3) Change OnResize() to set an orthographic projection viewport.
	4) Override OnUpdateFrame() to adjust the rotation amount based on time passed.
	5) Modify OnRenderFrame() to adjust the modelview based on the rotation amount.
	6) Modify the drawing calls to use the original screen's WIDTH/HEIGHT for vertices.
	7) Modify the Run() method to pass the number of times OnUpdateFrame() is called per second.
