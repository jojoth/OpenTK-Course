Tutorial #7 - Player Movement Using Modelview Translations
----------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
	We want our character to move when the left and right keys are held down.

Steps:
	1) Start with Tutorial06.
	2) Add the private variable "xPos" initialized to 0. This will track the player's x
	   position on the screen.
	3) Add the private variable "moveSpeed" initialized to 100f. This is the distance we
	   want our player to move per second (defaulting to 100px / sec).
	4) Change OnUpdateFrame() to add or remove moveSpeed from the player's xPos based
	   on whether they are pressing left or right.
	5) Change OnRenderFrame() to translate the modelview's position by player's xPos
	   prior to drawing our player.
