Tutorial #1 - Creating a Minimal Empty OpenTK Window
----------------------------------------------------

Objective:
	Create a minimal OpenTK project that simply opens a window with an OpenGL context that we can
	build on.

Steps:
	1) Create a new C# console project.
	2) Add a reference to System.Draw.dll and OpenTK.dll assemblies.
	3) Derive your main class from GameWindow.
	4) Add an empty constructor that calls the base constructor with width/height/title settings
	   for the window.
	5) Override OnLoad() and initialize the OpenGL context with a dark gray clear color.
	6) Override OnRenderFrame() and tell our GameWindow to Clear() the screen and to SwapBuffers().
	7) Instantiate and Run() your class from static main().
