Tutorial #5 - Animating Our Caveman
-----------------------------------

Objective:
	Remove the rotation code, fix the alpha transparency, and animate our caveman.

Steps:
	1) Start with Tutorial04.
	2) Replace the caveman.png image with the caveman-tiled.png image that includes multiple
	   frames of animation, and set its "Copy to Output Directory" property to either "Copy
	   if newer" or "Copy always."
	3) Add the private variable "charAnimIndex" initialized to zero. This will maintain the
	   value of our current frame of animation, and will be incremented during the update.
	4) Add the private variable "charTextureIndexes" as an array of Vector2, and initialize
	   it to equal the texture coordinates of each of the frames of animation in our PNG.
	5) Change OnLoad() to load the new caveman-tiled.png file instead of caveman.png.
	6) Change OnUpdateFrame() to increment our charAnimIndex counter by one, and rollback
	   to 0 before it reaches 8 (our character's standing frame which we are not using).
	7) Change OnRenderFrame() to use the coordinates from our charTextureIndexes array
	   based on the current index value in charAnimIndex.
	8) Change static Main() to lower the # of times our OnUpdateFrame() gets called per
	   second. This is a temporary hack in order to slow down the animation.
