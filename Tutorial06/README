Tutorial #6 - Handling Keyboard Input
-------------------------------------

Objective:
	We want our character to face the direction the player presses (left or right), and to
	only animate when the key is held down.

Steps:
	1) Start with Tutorial05.
	2) Change initialization value of "charAnimIndex" to 7 since we want him to be standing
	   still at the start up of the application.
	3) Add the private variable "isMoving" initialized to false. This will be used to track
	   whether the animation needs to run or not.
	4) Add the private variable "direction" initialized to 1. This will track the direction
	   the player was last facing. -1 for left, 1 for right.
	5) Add one additional texture coordinate to "charTextureIndexes" for our standing frame
	   of the caveman image.
	6) Change OnUpdateFrame() to check for left/right keypresses, and toggle the direction
	   and isMoving variables appropriately. Also switch the animation frame based on
	   whether the player is moving or standing.
	7) Change OnRenderFrame() to multiply the X coordinates of the player's vertices by
	   direction. This will effectively flip our polygon horizontally when our direction
	   changes.
